### Art Piece 1
![Fakebook](images/fakebook.png?raw=true "Fakebook")

I chose “Fakebook” by Fathom because I have been following the news about Russian influence of the 2016 election and wanted to learn more about it. The piece displays a sample of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked agents to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This sample of ads was released by the House Intelligence Committee in 2017. Fathom uses an algorithm to group the ads by demographics targeted. The Russian agents used knowledge of individuals' "interests" on Facebook to target particular demographics of potential voters. Fakebook then grouped the ads by Topics Targeted, ranging from left- and right-wing groups to human rights to memes/internet. It also provides information on the number of views, costs, of the ads, and date displayed. Stylistically, the piece uses various shades of blue remniscient of Facebook's color scheme. It also uses a similar scrolling mechanism to how you might scroll a Facebook feed. It is different than a Facebook newsfeed because only one post is highlighted at a time and additional information appears. Any other posts are muted to the background until they are put in the center of the screen. There is a ton of data used in the piece, but the scrolling mechanism and highlighting a single piece at a time makes it easy to peruse the ads and get a general idea of the messaging.

I chose "Between Five Bells" wine labels by Feltron. I thought this piece was interesting because it uses data visualization to create an aestetically pleasing consumer product. It visualizes information about the type of wine and the particular bottles. The wines displayed are blends of several types of wine and the labels show the proportons of each type of wine within it. It also shows temperatures of the wine and various other aspects of the winemaking process. I really like this piece because I enjoy wine but find it difficult to understand the nuances of wine types and the winemaking process. Displaying visualizations of wine data on the bottle label makes it easier to understand what makes a particular bottle taste the way it does. It gives more information to the consumer in a way that's easy to comprehend.

### Art Piece 3

![Immigration Tree Trunks](images/immigration.png?raw=true "Immigration Tree Trunks")

This piece by Pedro M. Cruz, John Wihbey, Avni Ghael, and Felipe Shibuya at Northeastern University is called "Immigration in the United States Visualized as Rings of Tree Trunk." It takes data about U.S. immigration by origin at birth from 1830 - 2015 and creates a colorful visualization of patterns of immigration in U.S. history. They construct it such that rings are made up of colorful dashes and each single dash represents 100 immigratnts. Each ring represents one decade. Colors represent various regions of the world from which immigrants came to the U.S. Together, this uses a tree trunk metaphor. In trees, cells grow slowly and the pattern of growth dictates the shape of the trunk. Similarly, incoming immigrants as individuals slowly make up patterns that change the shape and nature of the country. I really appreciate how individuals (or small groups of individuals) make grand patterns. The colors and abstract shape make a beautiful image, something I think recognizes the beauty that immigrants bring to shaping a country. In a political moment of such anti-immigrant sentiment, I appreciate how this visualization chooses to interpret the value of immigrants.
